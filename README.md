--- I HAVE POSTED SIMPLE NODE JS CODE AND ALSO SCREENSHOT OF THE CODE WHICH HELPS TO UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT CLEARLY ---

UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENCE B/W SYNCHRONOUS JS AND ASYNCHRONOUS JS WITH SIMPLE NODE.JS 

---SYNCHRONOUS---

In synchronous, tasks are performed one at time which means you need to wait for a task to finish to move to the next one.
You cannot move next task untill the previous one finishes.

see the screenshot - the code throw an error because file path is wrong at the same time it doesn't go to the next line.

---ASYNCHRONOUS---

In Asynchronous, you can move to another task before the previous one finishes at the same time you can handle multiple requests simultaneously.

see the screenshot - the code throw an error because file path is wrong at the same time it go to the next line and display the content.
