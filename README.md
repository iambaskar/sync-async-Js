--- I HAVE POSTED SIMPLE NODE JS CODE AND ALSO SCREENSHOT OF THE CODE WHICH HELPS TO UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT CLEARLY ---

UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENCE B/W SYNCHRONOUS JS AND ASYNCHRONOUS JS WITH SIMPLE NODE.JS 

---SYNCHRONOUS---

In synchronous, tasks are performed one at time which means you need to wait for a task to finish to move to the next one.
You cannot move next task untill the previous one finishes.

Synchronous code is also called “blocking” as it halts the program until all the resources are available.

---ASYNCHRONOUS---

In Asynchronous, you can move to another task before the previous one finishes at the same time you can handle multiple requests simultaneously.

Asynchronous code is also known as “non-blocking”. The program continues executing and doesn’t wait for external resources (I/O) to be available.
---What Is Input/Output or I/O?---
I/O is the communication between a program and the outside world such as file systems, databases, and network requests.
